* Deep CNN base SR models do not make full use of the hierarchical features from the original low-resolution (LR) images, thereby achieving relatively-low performance. Propose a novel Residual Dense Network (RDN) to address this problem in image SR. Because it fully exploit the hierarchical features from all the convolutional layers. Propose Residual Dense Block (RDB) to extract abundant local features via dense connected convolution layers and allow direct connections from the state of preceding RDB to all the layers of current RDB. After fully obtaining dense local features, use global feature fusion to jointly and adaptively learn global hierarchical features in a holistic way.
